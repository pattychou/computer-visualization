## Task 1ï¼šBuild a neural network and train the model
refer to neural_net.py  &       train.py

You can simply run train.py to start training the model.
## Task 2: Parameter search  
refer to tune.py

In this section, we will tune hyperparameters and store the
best trained model.

## Task 3: Test the model and visualize the results   
test_bestmodel.py      &     visualize.py
