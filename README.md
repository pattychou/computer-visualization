## preparations:
The MNIST database is a large collection of handwritten digits. It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. In this task, we will train and test our neural network on the mnist dataset. mnist.py helps us download the mnist dataset and save it in the format we want. 

## Task 1ï¼šBuild a neural network and train the model
refer to neural_net.py  &       train.py

You can simply run train.py to start training the model.
## Task 2: Parameter search  
refer to tune.py

In this section, we will tune hyperparameters and store the
best trained model.

## Task 3: Test the model and visualize the results   
test_bestmodel.py      &     visualize.py
